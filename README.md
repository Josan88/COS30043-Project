## Technical Implementation Details

### Service Layer Architecture

- **ProductService.js**: Menu data management and filtering
- **AuthService.js**: User authentication and session management
- **CartService.js**: Shopping cart operations and persistence
- **DatabaseService.js**: Data persistence and API simulation
- **LocationService.js**: Geolocation and restaurant address management

#### LocationService - Enhanced Restaurant Positioning

**Core Functionality:**
The LocationService implements an intelligent restaurant positioning system based on the assumption that the user's current location represents the restaurant location. This approach is ideal for in-restaurant ordering scenarios.

**Key Features:**

1. **Dynamic Restaurant Location Detection**

   - Uses browser's Geolocation API to detect current position
   - Automatically sets restaurant coordinates to user's location
   - Supports both high and standard accuracy positioning

2. **Intelligent Address Mapping**

   - Converts GPS coordinates to realistic Malaysian addresses
   - Location-aware mapping for major Malaysian cities:
     - **Kuching, Sarawak** (1.4-1.7°N, 110.2-110.5°E)
     - **Kuala Lumpur** (3.0-3.3°N, 101.5-101.8°E)
     - **Petaling Jaya, Selangor** (3.0-3.2°N, 101.5-101.7°E)
     - **Johor Bahru, Johor** (1.4-1.6°N, 103.6-103.9°E)
     - **George Town, Penang** (5.3-5.5°N, 100.2-100.4°E)

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - Default restaurant location when geolocation fails
   - Graceful degradation for browsers without location support
   - Cached location data for performance optimization

**Implementation Example:**

```javascript
// LocationService usage in components
async detectLocation() {
  try {
    await window.LocationService.detectLocation();
    this.userLocation = window.LocationService.getUserLocation();
    this.restaurantLocation = window.LocationService.getRestaurantLocation();
  } catch (error) {
    // Falls back to default restaurant address
    console.warn("Using default restaurant location");
  }
}
```

**Cross-Component Integration:**

- **HomePage**: Initializes location detection for personalized experience
