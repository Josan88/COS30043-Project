## Technical Implementation Details

### Service Layer Architecture

- **ProductService.js**: Menu data management and filtering
- **AuthService.js**: User authentication and session management
- **CartService.js**: Shopping cart operations and persistence
- **DatabaseService.js**: Data persistence and API simulation
- **LocationService.js**: Geolocation and restaurant address management

#### LocationService - Enhanced Restaurant Positioning

**Core Functionality:**
The LocationService implements an intelligent restaurant positioning system based on the assumption that the user's current location represents the restaurant location. This approach is ideal for in-restaurant ordering scenarios.

**Key Features:**

1. **Dynamic Restaurant Location Detection**

   - Uses browser's Geolocation API to detect current position
   - Automatically sets restaurant coordinates to user's location
   - Supports both high and standard accuracy positioning

2. **Intelligent Address Mapping**

   - Converts GPS coordinates to realistic Malaysian addresses
   - Location-aware mapping for major Malaysian cities:
     - **Kuching, Sarawak** (1.4-1.7°N, 110.2-110.5°E)
     - **Kuala Lumpur** (3.0-3.3°N, 101.5-101.8°E)
     - **Petaling Jaya, Selangor** (3.0-3.2°N, 101.5-101.7°E)
     - **Johor Bahru, Johor** (1.4-1.6°N, 103.6-103.9°E)
     - **George Town, Penang** (5.3-5.5°N, 100.2-100.4°E)

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - Default restaurant location when geolocation fails
   - Graceful degradation for browsers without location support
   - Cached location data for performance optimization

**Implementation Example:**

```javascript
// LocationService usage in components
async detectLocation() {
  try {
    await window.LocationService.detectLocation();
    this.userLocation = window.LocationService.getUserLocation();
    this.restaurantLocation = window.LocationService.getRestaurantLocation();
  } catch (error) {
    // Falls back to default restaurant address
    console.warn("Using default restaurant location");
  }
}
```

**Cross-Component Integration:**

- **HomePage**: Initializes location detection for personalized experience
- **ShoppingCart**: Uses dynamic restaurant address for order confirmation
- **PurchasesPage**: Displays location-aware restaurant information in order history

**Benefits:**

- **Realistic Restaurant Addresses**: Shows proper Malaysian street names and postcodes
- **Location-Aware Experience**: Adapts to user's actual geographical location
- **Seamless Integration**: Works across all order types (dine-in, pickup, delivery)
- **Professional Presentation**: Restaurant address appears legitimate and local

**Sample Output for Kuching, Sarawak:**

```
FoodNow Restaurant, Jalan Padungan
Kuching, 93100
Malaysia
```

### Configuration Modules

- **router.js**: Vue Router configuration with navigation guards

### Testing and Quality Assurance:

- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Device Testing**: Mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation
- **Performance Testing**: PageSpeed Insights and Lighthouse audits
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier for consistent formatting
- **Location Services Testing**: Geolocation functionality across different devices and browsers

### Location Services Verification:

The application's location-aware restaurant system has been tested across multiple scenarios:

- **Desktop Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari with location permissions
- **Mobile Devices**: iOS Safari and Android Chrome with GPS accuracy
- **Fallback Scenarios**: Graceful degradation when location services are disabled
- **Malaysian Coordinates**: Verified mapping for major cities and postcodes
- **Cross-Component Integration**: Location data consistency across HomePage, ShoppingCart, and PurchasesPage

**Sample Test Results:**

- Kuching, Sarawak (1.5273, 110.3703) → "FoodNow Restaurant, Jalan Padungan, Kuching, 93100"
- Kuala Lumpur (3.1390, 101.6869) → "FoodNow Restaurant, Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur, 50200"
